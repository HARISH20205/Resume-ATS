eBramha Techworks Private Limited
• Developed a speech-to-text summarization system integrating Whisper for transcription and Pegasus for
summarization, enhancing processing speed and efficiency while significantly reducing overall processing
time and improving system performance.
• Conducted in-depth research on advanced NLP models such as PEGASUS, BERTsum and BART,
contributing to the development of effective solutions for tasks like summarization and language
understanding.
• Built a neural network for handwritten digit classification (MNIST) from scratch, implementing core
machine learning concepts like gradient descent and one-hot encoding.
Projects
VerbiSense: Interactive Document Retrieval System - Link
• Built the VerbiSense backend with FastAPI, optimizing document uploads, query processing, and API
performance for real-time interactions with the React frontend.
• Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved document retrieval and response
generation.
• Applied PyTorch models for advanced NLP tasks like semantic understanding and context-based querying.
Speech-to-Text Summarization
• Developed a Python script that improved audio transcription accuracy by 30% and reduced
post-processing time by 35%.
• Designed and implemented the frontend interface to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience for
individuals interacting with the speech-to-text summarization system.
